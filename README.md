# trampolining-beyond-the-call-stack

An [Interview Cake problem](https://www.interviewcake.com/question/javascript/merge-sorted-arrays?course=fc1&section=array-and-string-manipulation) (paraphrased):

> "We have lists of orders sorted numerically in arrays. Write a function to merge our arrays of orders into one sorted array."

My solution:

```ts
/**
 * Merges two sorted arrays into a single, sorted array.
 * Complexity: O(n^2)?
 */
function mergeArraysRecursive(
  arrA: number[],
  arrB: number[],
): number[] {
  // Base case 1: both arrays are empty.
  if (arrA.length === 0 && arrB.length === 0) {
    return [];
  }

  // Base case 2a: arrA is empty, arrB is not.
  if (arrA.length === 0 && arrB.length > 0) {
    return arrB;
  }
  // Base case 2b: arrB is empty, arrA is not.
  if (arrB.length === 0 && arrA.length > 0) {
    return arrA;
  }

  // Recursive case: both arrays have elements.
  const [elA, ...restA] = arrA;
  const [elB, ...restB] = arrB;

  if (elA < elB) {
    return [elA, ...mergeArraysRecursive(restA, arrB)];
  } else {
    return [elB, ...mergeArraysRecursive(arrA, restB)];
  }
}
```

This is not optimal and NodeJS' recursion limit will be reached when either input array contains 10,000 or more elements. [Interview Cake's solution](https://github.com/bryik/trampolining-beyond-the-call-stack/blob/main/src/mergeArraysIterative.ts#L9) is optimal and works on arrays larger than 10,000 elements thanks to using an iterative approach instead of a recursive approach. While I do find juggling indices in a `while` loop to be more error-prone and harder to follow than the relatively straight-forward recursive solution, spontaneous failure is hard to ignore!

Are recursive algorithms a lost cause? No. Some languages have a built-in optimization for recursive functions called tail-call optimization (TCO).

> "...when a function returns the result of calling itself, the language doesnâ€™t actually perform another function call, it turns the whole thing into a loop for you." - [Raganwald](https://raganwald.com/2013/03/28/trampolines-in-javascript.html)

Only functions that either return a value or return a function call to themselves are candidates for TCO (consult [Raganwald's excellent article](https://raganwald.com/2013/03/28/trampolines-in-javascript.html) for a more thorough explanation). As it is `mergeArraysRecursive()` is not a candidate for TCO because it makes a recursive call and uses the result to construct an array `[elA, ...mergeArraysRecursive(restA, arrB)];`. However all is not lost, `mergeArraysRecursive()` can be rewritten in tail-recursive form [without too much trouble](https://github.com/bryik/trampolining-beyond-the-call-stack/blob/main/src/mergeArraysTailRecursive.ts).

Unfortunately, [most JavaScript engines lack tail-call optimization](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/). There is some drama behind this as TCO is technically part of the ES6 specification, but Mozilla and Microsoft were [unable or unwilling to implement it in their respective browsers](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54721813/6591491) and Google ended up removing it from V8. Safari supports TCO though!

[JohanP on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54719630/6591491) suggests "trampolining":

> "...by using a trampoline technique, you can easily convert your code to run as if it is being tail optimized."

Is this true? Seems so!

The recursion limit is no longer hit:

```
# deno run --allow-hrtime ./beyondRecursionLimit.ts

Trampolined version has no problem...
    mergeArraysTrampolined() took an average of 1213.180 milliseconds to sort 10000 numbers.

Recursive version is doomed to fail...

error: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
export default function mergeArraysRecursive(
                                            ^
    at mergeArraysRecursive...
```

And an [optimized variant of the recursive solution](https://github.com/bryik/trampolining-beyond-the-call-stack/blob/main/src/mergeArraysTrampolinedOptimized.ts) is more or less as fast as the iterative solution:

```
# deno run --allow-hrtime ./comparisons.ts

Iterative solution vs optimized recursive solution...
    mergeArraysIterative() took an average of 0.498 milliseconds to sort 1000 numbers.
    mergeArraysTrampolinedOptimized() took an average of 0.769 milliseconds to sort 1000 numbers.
```

The problem with recursive functions is that each recursive call requires a stack frame and these frames build up until a base case is reached. Raganwald has a great analogy for this with `factorial()`: "it's as if we actually wrote out 1 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x ... before doing any calculations". 

Functions in tail-recursive form have the same problem, but they don't actually need the frames to persist. A trampolined function returns a ["continuation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation) (a function that can be called to continue a computation) and the [trampoline()](https://github.com/bryik/trampolining-beyond-the-call-stack/blob/main/src/trampoline.ts) keeps calling these continuations until the result is reached. Instead of a function calling itself recursively (accumulating frames until the base case is reached), you have a series of independent function calls (1 frame created and destroyed for each call).

Recursion is a rather risky technique; without TCO or trampolining, the recursion limit hangs above us like the sword of Damocles. And even with these tools, one must take care to write in tail-recursive form. Iterative solutions may be harder to read, but they avoid this issue entirely.

## development

First clone this repo and `cd` into it. You will need to have [deno](https://deno.land/) installed.

### installation

```bash
deno cache --reload --lock=lock.json ./deps.ts
```

### updating lock file

```bash
deno cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write ./deps.ts
```

### running tests

```bash
deno test
```

### running the benchmark

```bash
deno run --allow-hrtime ./comparisons.ts
```

#### running the recursion vs trampolined demo

```bash
deno run --allow-hrtime ./beyondRecursionLimit.ts
```

### permissions

Running with the [`--allow-hrtime` permission flag](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions) is optional, but leaving it out may reduce the accuracy of the benchmark as it [reduces the precision of `performance.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now#reduced_time_precision) which is used to measure execution time.

```ts
// ./src/benchmark.ts
export function benchmarkOnce(f: Function): number {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  f();
  const endTime = performance.now();
  return endTime - startTime;
}
```
